## Use Cases & Howto's

This app is mainly useful if you want to keep running an app that doesn't run when screen is off (eg. Youtube, TikTok).
Open your desired app and put it into small window mode. Then simply slide it to the edge of the screen. Keeping the screen on is not so good. So open up `Black 4 Battery` app to be the background.
Slide the in app brightness to the lowest. There you go, it keeps running without draining battery on other part of the screen.
